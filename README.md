## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**:
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd darshan-ai
pnpm install
```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your API keys to `.env.local`:
```env
# Required for AI Chatbot (free API key from https://console.groq.com)
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your-groq-api-key

# Optional: LiveKit for voice chat
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-project.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-livekit-api-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-livekit-api-secret

# Supabase (existing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

3. **Run development server**:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. **Open in browser**:
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Usage

1. **Landing Page** (`/`) - Choose your role and access the appropriate dashboard
2. **Pilgrim** (`/pilgrim`) - Book slots, view crowds, request help
3. **Admin** (`/admin`) - Manage capacity and broadcast alerts
4. **Police** (`/police`) - Track incidents and deploy units
5. **Medical** (`/medical`) - Manage emergency responses

## Production Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy DARSHAN.AI"
git push origin main
```

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
- Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Import your GitHub repository
- Configure environment variables if needed
- Deploy

### Environment Variables

For production, add these to your `.env.local` (development) or Vercel dashboard:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-deployment.vercel.app
```

## Database Integration (Future)

The system is designed to integrate with:
- **Supabase**: For PostgreSQL + real-time subscriptions
- **Firebase**: For real-time updates and cloud functions
- **MongoDB**: For flexible document storage
- **Prisma ORM**: For type-safe database access

Mock data is currently used for demonstration.

## Real-time Updates

The system uses polling for real-time updates (3-5 second intervals). For production deployment with thousands of users, consider:

1. **WebSocket Implementation**: Direct bidirectional communication
2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: One-way real-time updates
3. **Supabase Realtime**: Built-in real-time subscriptions
4. **Socket.io**: Full-duplex communication

## Security Considerations

Before production deployment:

1. **Authentication**: Implement user login/verification
   - Temple staff authentication
   - Police officer verification
   - Pilgrim identity confirmation
   - Medical personnel credentials

2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
   - Pilgrims can only view their data
   - Admin has full temple management
   - Police can't access medical details
   - Sensitive SOS data encrypted

3. **Data Privacy**: GDPR/privacy compliance
   - Location data encryption
   - Medical information protection
   - Consent management
   - Data retention policies

4. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting on endpoints
   - CSRF protection
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention

5. **Monitoring**: Track and log
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security incidents
   - System health

## Troubleshooting

### Real-time Updates Not Working
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify API routes are accessible
- Ensure polling interval isn't too aggressive

### Crowd Density Not Updating
- Verify `/api/crowd-density` endpoint returns data
- Check Network tab in browser DevTools
- Confirm `setInterval` is running in component

### SOS Not Triggering
- Verify POST to `/api/sos` succeeds
- Check pilgrim ID is included
- Monitor console for error messages
